NLP and Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project is an extensive exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) combined with data analysis, data preprocessing, visualization, and web scraping. The goal is to build and experiment with a variety of models to gain insights from textual data, process it effectively, and visualize meaningful patterns.

Features
Data Scraping:

Automated extraction of textual data from websites using web scraping techniques (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, etc.).
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and preparing textual data for analysis (handling missing data, stopword removal, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, etc.).
Feature extraction methods including TF-IDF, Bag of Words (BoW), and Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).
Natural Language Processing Models:

Implementation and experimentation with various NLP models, including:
Sentiment analysis models
Text classification - Logistic Regression
Topic modeling - NLTK (natural language toolkit)
Named Entity Recognition (NER) models - LSTM and keras
Transformer models like BERT
Data Analysis:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on text datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Analyzing word frequencies, n-grams, sentiment trends, and more.
Data Visualization:

Generating insightful visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to represent data distributions, word clouds, correlations, and model performance metrics.
Technologies Used
Python
Libraries:
pandas, numpy for data manipulation
scikit-learn, torch, for machine learning models
nltk, spaCy, TensorFlow, transformers for NLP
matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for data visualization
BeautifulSoup, Scrapy for web scraping
